An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, AA, of size NN, each memory location has some unique index, ii (where 0≤i<N0≤i<N), that can be referenced as A[i]A[i] (you may also see it written as AiAi).

Given an array, AA, of NN integers, print each element in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.

Note: If you've already solved our C++ domain's Arrays Introduction challenge, you may want to skip this.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, NN (the number of integers in AA).
The second line contains NN space-separated integers describing AA.

Constraints

    1≤Ai≤104, where Ai is the ith integer in A1≤Ai≤104, where Ai is the ith integer in A

Output Format

Print all NN integers in AA in reverse order as a single line of space-separated integers.
